About me
------
I am a computational biologist with expertise in mechanisms of gene regulation and cancer genomics . My current role is a Project Officer for the [Genomic Data Commons]( https://gdc.cancer.gov/), with the Center for Cancer Genomics at the National Cancer Institute. In this role, I work to make the largest database of cancer genomics data a valuable resource for cancer researchers.  My research addresses the question of how cells can differentially deploy essentially the same gene content, to give rise to a host of specialized phenotypes and functions. By integrating analysis of diverse omics datasets, I seek to understand the mechanisms that control the regulation of gene expression.  Much of my focus has been on mechanisms that function after transcription, including RNA processing, splicing, and RNA modification. I am also interested in leveraging large scale datasets to make new discoveries about cancer etiology and treatment.
